    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, three different views to the tweets of the famous twitter account *WeRateDogs* were examined. The first view to the data comes from the [WeRateDogs tweets archive](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv). It contains the rates every dog got from the *WeRateDogs* authors. The second view to this tweets contains the [dog's breed](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv), which was classified by a neural network in the Udacity's *Machine Learning* Nanodegree program. And the last view to the tweets is accessed from twitter itself by using the [Tweepy API](https://www.tweepy.org/). This data contains how often a tweet was retweeted and labeled as favorite from other twitter users.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Which one is the best dog?\n",
    "\n",
    "All sources give us a different option to estimate the value of the dogs or at least of the corresponding tweets. The first data set gives us the `rates` the authors published in the tweet. This tells us which dogs gave the most pleasure to the authors. The second source gives us a predictability confidence for each tweet, which tells us how easy it is to predict the dog's breed. And the last source gives us a rating from the twitter community with every tweet's favorite and retweet counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have three different measures to rate the dogs: (1) the authors rating, (2) the neural network's breed prediction and (3) the twitter community's rating. Let's see which dogs are the best under each measurement. And aftwards, let's see if there are coherences between those measurements."
