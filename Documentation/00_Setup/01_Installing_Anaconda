		> conda create -n py2 python=2					# [example]

	- list all installed environments:
		> conda env list

	- removing an environement:
		> conda env remove -n env_name

	- activate your virtual environment:
		> source activate my_env						# [on Linus, OSX]
		> activate my_env								# [on Windows]

	- in the virtual environment you can list and install packages:
