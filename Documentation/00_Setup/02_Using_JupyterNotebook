# USING JUPYTER NOTEBOOK


1. Installing Jupyter Notebook

	> conda install jupyter Notebook 		#[with Conda]
	> pip install jupyter notebook 			#[with PIP]


2. Launching the notebook server

	> jupyter notebook
	- browse to: http://localhost:8888		# or http://localhost:8889


3. Install Notebook Conda
	
	- installing notebook conda:
		> conda install nb_conda

	- then a new tab in jupyter notebook appear: 'Conda' where you can manage your environements from browser


4. Shortcuts

	- inserting new cells with 'A' (above) and 'B' (below)
	- make cell a Markdown cell with 'M' and a Code cell with 'Y'
	- deleting a cell with two 'D', 'D'
	- saving notebook with 'S'
	- access the command palette by pressing Shift + Control/Command + 'P' (not in firefox)
	- show all keyboard shortcuts with 'H'


5. Build-in Magic Commands

	- set up matplotlib to work interactively in the notebook with 

		%matplotlib inline 			#[in first line of cell]

	- for retina displays make diagrams higher resoluted with

		%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'

	- activate interactive debugger to inspect variables in current namespace with

		%pdb						#[in first line of cell]
	
	- %: for line magics
	- %%: cell magics

	- more magic commands here: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html


6. Timing Code
	
	- meassure time for one line (e.g. one function)
		%timeit function1(20)
		%timeit function2(20)

	- meassure time for one cell
		%%timeit					#(in the first line of cell)


7. Markdown language

	- how to write mathematical expression and more see here: https://www.latex-tutorial.com/


8. Converting jupyter notebooks

	- for example to html, pdf or latex from browser GUI
	- or from console with command

	- see more here: https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html


9. Creating a slideshow

	- creating a slideshow from the browser notebook:
		View > Cell Toolbar > Slideshow

	- then you can tag every cell with a slideshow tag:

		SLIDES: are full slides that you move through left to right.
		SUB-SLIDES: show up in the slideshow by pressing up or down.
		FRAGMENTS: are hidden at first, then appear with a button press
		SKIP: You can skip cells in the slideshow with Skip and Notes leaves the cell as speaker notes.

	- convert to slideshow
		> jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides

	- then you can open the slideshow with the html file

	- or convert and view slideshow
		> jupyter nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to slides --post serve
