# Projects for the Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity

This is my repo for the projects I develop for the Udacity Nanodegree 'Data Analyst'.


## Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends

In this project the local weather trends in Berlin and the global weather trends are explored and visualized (Section 1 + 2). In the 3rd section the moving average is used to smooth out the lines. And in the 4th section an analysis of the local and global trends points out the similarites and differences between the local and the global weater trends and are interpreted.


## Project 2 - Brazil Patients Appointments

This project uses data that contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included for each appointment. Some personal details about the patient like age, gender and if they are part of a national scholarship program. But also medical relevant informations are included like if the patients suffer from diabetes, hipertension, alcoholism or an handicap. Additionally details about the scheduled and appointment day, the neighbourhood and if they received a reminder SMS for the appointment.

## Project 3 - Analysis of A/B test results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. But they come with some difficulties when applying them and interpreting their results. This project helps to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
